\begin_layout Title
The Traill island model for lemming dynamics, how it compares to Fennoscandian
 vole dynamics models, and a proposed simplification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The Traill island model of Gilg et al.
 (2003) is a landmark attempt at mechanistic modelling of the cyclic population
 dynamics of rodents, focusing on a high Arctic community.
 It models the dynamics of one prey, the collared lemming, and four predators
 : the stoat, the Arctic fox, the long-tailed skua and the snowy owl.
 In the present short note, we first summarize how the model works in light
 of theory on seasonally forced predator-prey systems, with a focus on the
 temporal dynamics of predation rates.
 We show notably how the impact of generalist predation, which is able here
 to initiate population declines, differs slightly from that of generalist
 predation in other mechanistic models of rodent-mustelid interactions such
 as Turchin & Hanski (1997).
 We then provide a low-dimensional approximation with a single generalist
 predator compartment that mimics the essential features of the Traill island
 model: cycle periodicity, amplitude, shape, as well as generalist-induced
 declines.
 This simpler model should be broadly applicable to model other lemming
 populations that predominantly grow under the snow during the winter period.
 Matlab computer codes for Gilg et al.
 (2003), its two-dimensional approximation, as well as alternative lemming
 population dynamics models are provided.

\begin_layout Standard
The predator-prey community in

 is constituted of one prey species, the collared lemming (
\emph on
Dicrostonyx groenlandicus
\emph default
), and its four predators: the stoat (
\emph on
Mustela erminea
\emph default
), the Arctic fox (
\emph on
Alopex lagopus
\emph default
), the long-tailed skua (
\emph on
Stercorarius longicaudus
\emph default
) and the snowy owl (
\emph on
Bubo scandiacus
\emph default
).
 The basic structure of the model is that of a coupled system of nonlinear
 differential equations for the lemming and stoat populations (present year-roun
d and all years), with time-varying terms.
 The time-varying part of the model results largely from avian and fox predation
 on lemmings, which happens only in the summer, in addition to a heightened
 intrinsic population growth of lemmings in winter.
 Finally, another forcing term comes from the stoat reproduction, which
 is modelled as a discontinuous burst, the stoat population being multiplied
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $(1+v)$
\end_inset

 every year in the spring.
 The model here is slightly reformulated to make its mathematical structure
 more apparent.
 The lemming population dynamics are described by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{dt}=\underbrace{r(t)N}_{\text{exp. growth}}-\underbrace{\Gamma(N,N',t)}_{\text{generalist predation}}-\underbrace{\frac{cN^{2}P}{D^{2}+N^{2}}}_{\text{specialist predation}}.
\end{equation}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For convenience, we will count time in unit of years, and define the variable
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\text{mod}}=t\equiv1$
\end_inset

, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\text{mod}}$
\end_inset

 is time of year between 0 and 1.
 A key variable is 
\begin_inset Formula $N'$
\end_inset

, the lemming density at snowmelt: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{array}{cc}
t_{\text{mod}}<t_{\text{snowmelt},} & N'=N(t)\,\&\,r(t)=r_{w}\\
t_{\text{mod}}>t_{\text{snowmelt}}, & N'=N(t_{\text{snowmelt}})\,\&\,r(t)=r_{s}
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $N'$
\end_inset

 can be thought of as a perceived lemming density by generalist and nomadic
 predators upon their seasonal arrival to the system, that introduces a
 short time delay in summer in the model (decisions made by the predators
 are conditional to 
\begin_inset Formula $N'$

).

 is exactly zero in winter, and changes during the summer as a function
 of settlement and reproduction schedules of the various predators.
 The stoat density 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 has dynamics of the form

 the two mortality rates according to the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(N)=1/2+\arctan(b(N-D))/\pi$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, there is a higher predator death rate when there is no
 food.
 The stoat compartment is additionally subjected to an interruption and
 modification of the state variable, i.e., each year at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\text{stoat}}$

 the integration stops and the predator density switches from 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $P(1+v)$

Whether patterns of generalist predator abundance in Fennoscandia truly
 explain the cyclicity gradient is currently unclear, because generalist

 in contrast increases cyclicity).

\begin_layout Enumerate
Long-tailed skuas keep the lemming cycle within bounds through predation
 during the summer and generate, together with owls, strong seasonal forcing.
 Their influence is therefore two-fold: (a) their generalist predation tends
 to keep lemmings in check but (b) the fact that such predation is seasonal
 contributes to the population cycling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The slightly delayed reproductive response of foxes can for some parameter
 sets create a short-period (2-year) cycle in absence of mustelids.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Stoats generate an eventually unstable lemming-stoat oscillation, which
 is transformed into a more sustainable attractor by generalists (skuas
 in particular).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our conclusion is therefore that both `generalists' such as skuas/owls/foxes
 and specialists such as mustelids contribute to some degree to generating
 collared lemming fluctuations in the Traill Island model.
 These considerations open up new challenges in defining the precise role
 of generalist (or nomadic specialists) versus resident specialist predators.

 The model assumes that all generalists behave like the skua (the more abundant

 It also assumes that the numerical response has the more simplifed Leslie-type

A cautionary tale on cycle shape in mechanistic models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has been proposed that cycle shape can be a proxy for cycle causation

 We offer a different view here.
 A difficulty with the numerous mechanistic mathematical models available
 to model rodent cycles is that they tend to produce cycles with correct
 periodicity and amplitude, but with shapes often different from that of
 the data.
 In other words, mechanistic models with empirically estimated parameters
 might not fit all the details of the cycle very well.
 For example, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "Fig. 4"
key "korpimaki2002dynamic"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 the mechanistic predation model consistently produces cycles that rank
 in the right side of Royama's triangle, where delayed density-dependence
 generates the crashes after a plateau at high density 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "royama1992analytical"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 However, the data shows often faster crashes, ranking on the left side
 of the triangle (Fig.
 4 in their paper).
 Conversely, the model in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "gilg2003cyclic"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 cited above tends to produce fast crashes in just one year while the data
 show crashes occurring over one or two years.
 This is arguably an undesirable property of the model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "oksanen2008arctic"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, which incidentally refutes the claims of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "turchin2000lemmings"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 have a rounded shape.
 The models by

literal "true"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 therefore seem to be equally good at describing periodicity and amplitude
 of the time series, but equally limited to reproduce cycle shape

This remark may very well apply to numerous other mechanistic models for
 cyclic populations.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 With rich datasets (e.g.
 >100 data points in this context), it might be possible to find the most
 likely models just based on cycle shape, but given the limited data available
 here (
\begin_inset Formula $\approx$
\end_inset

 25 years with no spatial replication, which is common in many stuch study
 sites), such endeavours may be a little premature.
 Mechanistic mathematical models may be best interpreted as illustrating
 what is 
\emph on
possible,
\emph default
 rather than what is actually happening in real populations.
 Although in some cases, it may be possible to at least rank different scenarios
 based on very contrasted models and multiple model diagnostics
