## Moss-vascular-lemming interaction models from Turchin & Batzli (2001)

Here we reproduce models from:

Turchin, P., & Batzli, G. O. (2001). Availability of food and the population dynamics of arvicoline rodents. Ecology, 82(6), 1521-1534.

In paricular their model VIII, the Barrow model with interaction between lemmings and their two food sources. Although this paper should be commanded for comparing a large suite of models rather than a handful, a few things may be best kept in mind:

* The model is well mixed. However, lemmings use in fact different habitats in winter and summer 

Batzli, G. O., Pitelka, F. A. and Cameron, G. N. 1983. Habitat use by lemmings near Barrow,
Alaska. Holarct. Ecol. 6: 255-262.

* The model assumes that the fraction of mosses eaten can reach one. This in fact never happens.
