## Simplified versions of the Gilg et al. (2003) model

Here we have crafted models that are intermediate in complexity between the parameter-rich model of Gilg et al. (2003) and the parcimonious attempt of Turchin & Hanski (1997). We pool together all generalist predators in one forcing term in the lemming population dynamics. 

* ``Leslie_numResp`` does that by using both a similar predation structure to Turchin & Hanski (1997) - with functional responses from Gilg et al. (2003) - as well as a Leslie-type numerical reponse. All the parameters are adapted to Arctic lemmings though. It is arguably our simplest & best smooth approximation of Gilg et al. (2003). 

* ``threshold_repro`` retains the threshold in predator reproduction of Gilg et al. (2003), although the predation part is simplified.
