## Host-parasite (SI) models

The SI models in that section originate as a bet between the two coders: that one can always find a formulation of contact rates (arguably one of the worst-estimated parameters...) that produces the right amplitude and periodicity to explain a given time series of observed fluctuations. The reader will be able to play with parameters and judge whether that is true. 

(of course, the mortality induced by the disease should be another criterion to judge model adequation to data -- this exercise really highlights how important it is to get demographic data from the various phases of the cycles to gauge whether the predicted mortality and reproduction rates make sense, rather than only whether amplitude and periodicity are correctly reproduced)
