** Models of lemming population cycles driven by predation 

The models presented here are based on the case study of lemming population cycles at Traill island, east Greenland (although they might apply with some modifications to other places as well). The original model for this case study has been published in Gilg et al. (2003) Sience XX:XXX-XXX. We consider a number of variants explained below. 

A major deviation from previous literature on vole dynamics pertains to the "inverted reproduction schedule" of lemmings: maximal rates of intrinsic growth for lemmings are in winter (they reproduce well under the snow), while population growth is (here) lower in summer. This allows seasonal generalist predation, occurring in the summer when the avian predators arrive, to have a large impact on lemming dynamics; it functions as seasonal, fluctuation-enhancing perturbation. 

In that sense, the models presented here differ from the classics like Turchin & Hanski American Naturalist 1997 (which are reproduced for comparison in the folder ``comparison_TH97``), in which (1) generalist predation is not seasonal and (2) rodent reproduce better in summer. 

We present two types of models
- The Gilg et al. (2003) model plus a variant with a different, Leslie-like numerical response
- ``Pooled generalists'' model, where the four generalist predators are aggregated in one compartment (their behaviour resembles then that of the long-tailed skua, which is the most abundant predator in Greenland).
